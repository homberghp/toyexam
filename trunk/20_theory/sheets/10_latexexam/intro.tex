\subsection{Problems in multilingual course}
\begin{frame}{}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The document language is not the teachers first
    language. Errors in the language may render questions
    questionable.
  \item Promote duos creating exams
  \item Ideally, a duo has a native speaker in the both/all document languages
  \item Promotes equal questions to all students, independent of
    language group
  \item Reduces fraud possibilities
  \item Automatic scoring of (MC) questions and help with scoring open
    questions.
  \end{itemize}
