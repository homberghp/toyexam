\subsection{Reuse}
\begin{frame}{Reuse is one of the strengths}
  
  Languages such as Java and PHP are so popular, not only because they
  are particularly good, but because they promote reuse \alert{AND}
  have a very rich library.

  With \LaTeX{}:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item there are numerous packages to solve almost anything
  \item you can write own macros
  \item reuse macros in other macros as kind of glue code
  \item can properly separate style from structure and contents (link
    with html+css).
  \item you can (de)compose a document into smaller (reusable) parts
    by \lstinline{\\input} or \lstinline{\\input} or \lstinline{\\usepackage}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Coding \LaTeX}
\begin{frame}{Properties of a \LaTeX source file}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Most of the source is the text you want to publish.
  \item There are a few special characters, most notably the
    \lstinline{\\}, the backslash; it introduces a macro call as in \lstinline{\\input\{filename\}}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
