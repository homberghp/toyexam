# This directory contains a set of files used in my standard fontys exam.
# Best results are obtained when this directory resides in the TEXINPUT path

# by
sudo svn co https://www.fontysvenlo.org/svnp/879417/fontexam/trunk /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/fontexam


# Once you've done that run texhash as root.
# sudo texhash

# This allows you to create a mc exam with little effort and 
# duplication of code (DRY principle).
